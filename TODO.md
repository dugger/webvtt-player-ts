# TODO - webvtt-player-ts

## Completed âœ…

- [x] Migrate from class components to functional components with hooks
- [x] Add TypeScript support and type definitions
- [x] Update to Vite build system
- [x] Add ESLint v9+ configuration with TypeScript and React support
- [x] Improve type safety (replace `any` types with proper interfaces)
- [x] Update README for TypeScript/Vite usage
- [x] Move search bar position (below player, above transcript)
- [x] Fix CSS layout issues with flex-wrap
- [x] Clean up unused dependencies (removed prop-types)
- [x] Add proper package.json type: "module" entry

## Next Steps ðŸš€

### Code Quality & Development Experience
- [ ] Add Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged) to run linting automatically
- [ ] Add TypeScript strict mode gradually
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
- [ ] Add ESLint rules for accessibility (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Add unit tests with Vitest or Jest
- [ ] Add component testing with React Testing Library
- [ ] Add Storybook for component documentation and visual testing
- [ ] Add integration tests for audio/transcript functionality
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Add React.memo() for performance optimization where needed
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large transcripts
- [ ] Add bundle size analysis
- [ ] Optimize CSS imports and reduce bundle size
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### Features & Enhancements
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- [ ] Add support for multiple audio formats
- [ ] Add support for custom themes/styling
- [ ] Add support for transcript export
- [ ] Add support for playback speed control
- [ ] Add support for volume control
- [ ] Add support for fullscreen mode

### Build & Deployment
- [ ] Set up automated testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Add automated deployment to npm
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for automated releases
- [ ] Add bundle analysis in build process
- [ ] Add source maps for better debugging

### Example & Demo
- [ ] Update example-usage to use latest features
- [ ] Add more comprehensive examples
- [ ] Create interactive demo with different transcript types
- [ ] Add examples for different use cases (podcasts, interviews, etc.)

## Notes

- The package now uses modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- TypeScript provides better type safety and developer experience
- Vite provides faster development and building
- ESLint ensures code quality and consistency
- The search bar is now positioned more intuitively

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: Prettier, pre-commit hooks, unit tests
2. **Medium Priority**: Storybook, accessibility improvements, performance optimization
3. **Low Priority**: Additional features, advanced documentation
